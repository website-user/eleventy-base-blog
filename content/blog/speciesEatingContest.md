On 24 November 2020, Ethan Mitchell challenged me to a species eating contest. "Species" includes plants, fungus, and animal species.

The winner of the challenge is the player who has eaten the most distinct species between the date of the challenge being accepted and the perihelion of comet 12P Pons-Brooks on 4/21/2024. 
To count, species must be consumed at more than 10g, so trace flavorings, individual bugs, and so on are not eligible.

Challenger: Ethan Mitchell
