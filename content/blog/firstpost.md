Nice to have a new homepage for myself on the internet. 

We'll see how well this format - I'm running 'Eleventy' - works with the content I've already got, and the stuff I've been writing in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

Do markdown links work in here? Adding images seemed.... weird.

What other stuff works? 

# Header 1
blah blah

##### Header 5
blah blah

> quote text. 
> quote contiuned.

> weird - quotes break line breaks.
>> double inset what happens

- bullet point test 
> - inset bullet test 
> > - 2x inset test 

Can we add images from the web?

Just added three blank lines above this line - how does that render?
_underscore italics test_ and **double star bold test** and *single star test*
