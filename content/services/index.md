    I like to work to supporting people at the intersection of creativity, learning, and communication by designing creative learning experiences, managing programs, and building relationships.

I am always looking for new formats to work in that make the world a more playful and participatory place. Here you can find some formats I've worked with in the past, but keep in mind I'm always up for designing new solutions for your context.

- [Design](#tab-design)
- [Learning Communities](#tab-learningcommunities)
- [Facilitation](#tab-facilitation)

Design for playful learning means making "objects to think with."  
Blocks create a playable interface with gravity for toddlers that are building their first mental models of the world. My design work builds on building blocks to create playable interfaces with complex ideas.

I make play materials and guidebooks that empower people to make creative choices and learn through playful exploration.

All communities, be they workplaces or makerspaces, are learning communities; but they're not created equal. The culture of every community can evolve to be more participatory, equitable, playful, and creative. I have worked with many organizations to create tools and cultivate a culture of learning and cooperation.

The 21st century is collaborative. Don't preach at; play with.  
I design and facilitate workshops and events that give people a context to play and explore new tools and mediums. Play promotes deeper learning, strengthening social ties, and stimulates creative thinking.
